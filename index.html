    <p>While developing any programming language, syntax is as important as the underlying principles. So, I kept thinking about <b>how to simplify programming to ease a beginner's mindset.</b></p>

    <p>As a result, I've developed a new programming language named Saalang.</p>
    <p>It includes variables similar to Python, most of which support a structure called properties. Additionally, it features functions capable of updating existing variables or generating new ones. Looping is achieved using loop, after, until, finally, and except clauses. It also provides various clauses for dynamic error management, temporary variable storage, and other purposes.</p>
    <p>There is so much more about this language, for which I’ve attached some PDF files:</p>

        <li><a href="files/04 Datetime.pdf" style="color: #00695c;" download>Datetime</a></li>
    </b></ol>

    <p>I have also prepared <b><a href="files/Examples.pdf" style="color: #004d40;" download>some examples</a></b> as well.</p>

    <p>Introduction covers some differences from Python. Examples would be very helpful for a deeper understanding of this language. Understanding properties may be a new concept, but it becomes easier once grasped.</p>

    <p>Be a beginner! Take a look at these PDF files, explore the language, and feel free to reach out if you have any questions or suggestions!</p>

    <p>P.S. સળંગ (सालंग) means “continuous”, emphasizing the ability of properties to work one after another.</p>
